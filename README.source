slyther for Debian
-----------------

Dick Balaska's slyther derives from gegy's Slyther.
Debian wants lower case letters, hence the project name change.

The root build.gradle builds the client jar.
The server subdirectory build.gradle builds the server from the
same source with a different entry point.
